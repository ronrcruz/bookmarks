            This mini bookmark is the perfect companion for any reader!<br /><br />

            My well-redesign is inspired by my book club, the Wellread book club. Bein can mean many different things, but I associate it with reading from a wide variety of genresâ€¦ which is our goal for the book club. Each month, we read a book from a different genre. <br /><br />

            I thought it would be fun to design a mini bookmark that we could use for the books we read for the book club, or any of our books!<br /><br />

            <span className="italic font-serif">You dve to be a member of the book club to purchase this item. I just want to make that clear :)</span><br /><br />

            I also think of a well-read book is a book that has been annotated, dog eared, highlighted, or underlined. If yoe that kind of reader, then this book mark is perfect for you!<br /><br />

            This mini bookmark is printed on thick high quality paper, has gold-foil accents, and a nice buttery matte finish. Italso double-sided, so whichever way you place it in your book y have a lovely design to see.
