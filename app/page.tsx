            This mini bookmark is the perfect companion for any reader!<br /><br />

            My “I&#39;m well-read” design is inspired by my book club, the Wellread book club. Being “well-read” can mean many different things, but I associate it with reading from a wide variety of genres… which is our goal for the book club. Each month, we read a book from a different genre. <br /><br />

            I thought it would be fun to design a mini bookmark that we could use for the books we read for the book club, or any of our books!<br /><br />

            <span className="italic font-serif">You don&#39;t have to be a member of the book club to purchase this item. I just want to make that clear :)</span><br /><br />

            I also think of a well-read book is a book that has been annotated, dog eared, highlighted, or underlined. If you&#39;re that kind of reader, then this book mark is perfect for you!<br /><br />

            This mini bookmark is printed on thick high quality paper, has gold-foil accents, and a nice buttery matte finish. It&#39;s also double-sided, so whichever way you place it in your book you&#39;ll have a lovely design to see.

            I&#39;ve had the idea for this bookmark design for quite a while, and it was so much fun to finally bring it to life!<br /><br />

            Picture this: you&#39;re in the middle of reading a book, when someone interrupts and starts talking to you. Simply hold up your bookmark (the side that has &#34;Hello&#34; crossed out... &#34;I&#39;m reading&#34;) and they will hopefully get the hint to leave you and your book in peace :P<br /><br />

            With this bookmark, you must choose: protagonist or antagonist... Will you join ther dark side, or will you be the hero of your own story?<br /><br />

            Side note: I truly love this design and how you can flip between &#34;the dark&#34; and &#34;the light&#34; !!!<br /><br />

            This mini bookmark is printed on thick high quality paper, has gold-foil accents, and a nice buttery matte finish. It&#39;s also double-sided, so whichever way you place it in your book you&#39;ll have a lovely design to see.
